// Quest 6 â€“ Scan Node Sequence
//  Difficulty: Easy (2 pts)
// Story
//  You need to scan the first five nodes in sequence to map the Grid.
// Objective
//  Use a for loop to log each node number in order.
// Instructions
// Name your file quest6.js


// Use a for loop that starts at 1, ends at 5, and increments by 1


// Inside the loop, print the exact sentence for each iteration, for example:
//  Scanning node: 1


// Acceptance Criteria
// The loop runs from 1 through 5


// The console shows exactly:
//  Scanning node: 1
//  Scanning node: 2
//  Scanning node: 3
//  Scanning node: 4
//  Scanning node: 5



for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(`Scanning node: ${i + 1}`);
  }
